Overview:

This is a simple temperature conversion program written in C++. The program allows the user to convert temperatures between six common units: Celsius, Fahrenheit, and Kelvin. The user can select one of the conversion options, input the temperature to convert, and the program will output the result in the desired unit.

Objectives:

1. Temperature Conversion: The main objective is to convert temperatures between the following units:

Celsius to Fahrenheit

Celsius to Kelvin

Fahrenheit to Celsius

Fahrenheit to Kelvin

Kelvin to Celsius

Kelvin to Fahrenheit



2. Interactive User Input: The program provides an interactive menu where the user can select the conversion they wish to perform.


3. Mathematical Computation: The program applies mathematical formulas to perform the conversion. These formulas include:

Celsius to Fahrenheit: 

Celsius to Kelvin: 

Fahrenheit to Celsius: 

Fahrenheit to Kelvin: 

Kelvin to Celsius: 

Kelvin to Fahrenheit: 



4. Error Handling: The program includes basic error handling for invalid choices by the user (if the user enters a number outside the range of 1 to 6).



Technologies Used:

Programming Language: The program is written in C++, a widely used programming language known for its performance and flexibility.

Standard Input/Output: The program uses the standard C++ input and output libraries (iostream) to interact with the user via the console.

cin: For taking input from the user.

cout: For displaying output to the user.


Control Flow: The program uses a switch-case statement to allow the user to choose which temperature conversion to perform. The program executes the corresponding code block based on the user's input.


Key Concepts and Techniques Used

1. Variables: The program uses integer and double variables (choice, temperature, and convertedTemp) to store the user's choice, input temperature, and the converted temperature, respectively.


2. User Interaction: The program prompts the user to select a conversion option and input a temperature value, providing feedback with the result of the conversion.


3. Mathematical Calculations: The program performs basic arithmetic operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division) to convert temperatures between units.


4. Switch-Case Statement: This control structure is used to execute different code blocks based on the user's input (the choice variable). Each case corresponds to one of the temperature conversion options.



Conclusion

This program demonstrates how C++ can be used to create a practical tool for temperature conversions. It offers a clear example of using user input, mathematical operations, and control flow structures in a simple and interactive way.
